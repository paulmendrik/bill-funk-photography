I then did some shots of my  skeleton outside on the patio at home and in the bedroom in different  positions so I’d have options for positioning him in the montage. He was  pretty cooperative but got a bit pissy when I told him he wouldn’t get  paid. I just told him there was no budget and that seemed to shut him  up…",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"At first I didn’t have a clear idea of what the finished image  would be, though the scenario started to evolved as I tried different  set ups. Fact is, when I visited that spooky chamber, it was hard not to  imagine and actually feel the anguish of torture and executions that  happened there in ages past. So I went with that and added some extra  elements (like the sword and bondage rings on the walls) to reinforce  the story line.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"But there was something missing… maybe bats flying  round overhead? Of course they needed to be skeletal too, so I searched  Google for royalty free bat skeleton images and was totally blown away  to find so many to choose from !!\nIt took an obscene amount of time  to isolate all the bones (and that goes for my friend’s as well) from  the background images and to position everything and balance the  lighting of all the elements.
