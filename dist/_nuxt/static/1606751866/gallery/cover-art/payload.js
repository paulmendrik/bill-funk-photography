Some I  photographed from the actual LP and CD covers, some I've had to search  out on the web on sites like Discogs. For the records made in later  years, mainly since about 2000, the job's been relatively easy as the  quality of the on-line material is usable for the most part. The problem  with the earlier records is that back in the day there apparently  wasn't much importance placed on documenting album art, especially for  the less famous work. And naturally we wanted all the pictures in our  book to be artistically top notch.",spans:[]},{type:b,text:"So I set to the task of  optimizing poor quality images, not only from the on-line sources but  also from photos of actual LP albums (from as far back as the early  80's) which hadn't been looked after well. I delved deep into the depths  of Photoshop working on this project for over a year, mainly as regards  getting low resolution images resized to print quality without  distraction of noise, fuzziness and digital artifacts.",spans:[]},{type:b,text:"In this  example, I found a picture of an album we did in the 90's which was on  sale on eBay (left). It was the only picture I could find with the  special edition cover showing the actual studio setting in the  background. I started by using a perspective crop tool to bring the  sides straight and create an 8 x 8cm x 300 dpi image. It wasn't too  difficult getting the colors and contrast right, but the reflections of  the plastic CD cover needed to be worked on manually to reconstruct the  content underneath.
