Alas, no longer with us as he passed away very  young. Here his eyes were just changeing color and I thought I’d try to  get a pose out of him. Trouble was keeping him awake long enough to get a  shot. Seconds after taking this, he slumped down into the jar, deep in  little kitty dreamland. It wasn’t even easy getting him out !",spans:[]},{type:b,text:"I  shot this with a Canon EOS 100 SLR + EF 100 mm fixed focal on Fuji Reala  100 ISO color print film, using a homemade softbox which was my first  venture into `studio’ flash. As a result, there were reflections all  over the glass and especially on the neck of the jar which totally hid  OJ`s fur. So I scanned the neg (Canon FS 2710 scanner) and cloned over  the reflections with the few bits of fur that were visible through the  glass in Photoshop 6. I also took advantage of Photoshop to adjust  colors and levels till I was OK with his contrast against the  background. It was one of my first delves into Photoshop and I learned  lots about cloning, selecting, feathering and so much else through this…  so not only does the nostalgia pertain to the subject, but to the  processing as well.",spans:[]}],page:"Page 2",tag:"pets"}}],fetch:[],mutations:void 0}}(null,"paragraph")));
