She works with brushes and spatulas and possibly a  finger here and there, and she wears cool clothes (doesn’t get much  cooler than skull shirts) and sixties jewelry that acytually inspired me  to look for my peace sign cuff links which I amazingly FOUND !!\nShe  unfortunately doesn’t smell of turpentine cause she uses mainly acrylic  paints but she’s got a sweet smile that makes up for that… and she digs a  photo shoot now and again which gave me about 150 fabulous pictures, a  couple of which she’ll probably use for some artistic project… most of  which will probably get buried on my hard drive and never see the light  of day.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"Most of the shots were full body to show off what she was  wearing.
