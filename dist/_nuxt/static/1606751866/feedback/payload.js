Like walking through an extensive art gallery packed with photosa, portraits people and objects. Your creations like good poetry, force me to reexamine myself and my place in thev world. Great for meditation. U didn't see a place order prints. If I missed it, forgive me. I will keep praising this virtual art exhibit. Wow!",spans:[]}],reply:[{type:a,text:"Valerie, your take on my stuff rocks. It makes me so happy to hear when my affliction inspires in a positive way... and to see it related to poetry in any way is the sweetest icing on the planet.

Your work is Tippytop notch and it I everwever see you in person I want a photo taken by you !!and I will of course shoot you as well (obv with camera!!)\nThese are wonderful in so many ways!! Great idea to do this ! Now you have your work in a beautiful collection and safe from whatever RB decides to do (I swear some of my art has disappeared over time on their website) Cheers My Dear!!! xox",spans:[]}],reply:[{type:a,text:"Von, you know how much your positive feedback is appreciated on my planet!\nI did feel the need to have my stuff in a place where I had more control over presentation than I had on RB. My work does still sell over there so I'll hopefully never run out of chewing gum... but in here it's more about me and my creativity rather than marketing with hard sell. So yes, I'm now happy to have visitors come round for a browse and massive thanks for yours!\nAnd I got no problem with fitting you in for a duel at dawn...\nCheers right backatcha!!! xx",spans:[]}]},{date:c,name:[{type:a,text:"Alun",spans:[]}],comment:[{type:a,text:"Great work and a lovely site to present it. Congrats!\n\nI am also involved in photography (it was a source of income for a few years even), and presently President of the Viewfinders photography club of Brussels. We are a real-live physical club holding meetings once a month, at the Swedish church near Merode metro station, when we often invite external speakers to present their work. Working language is English but members hail from all parts of the globe.Great fun and good for networking. It's a very laid-back club, certainly not geeky, with members who are:have been pro\u002Fsemi-pro to those who just like looking at pictures. You'd be welcome to show your work as a presenter, too!\nCheers,\nA.",spans:[]}],reply:[{type:a,text:"Thanks for the invite Alun, and for being my very first feedback comment !\nSo little time these days with work, but it would be good to finally connect and exchange ideas. In the meantime I'll check out the Viewfinders website & FB, sounds like a cool place. Also let me know where I can see some of your work!\nL8R,\nBill",spans:[]}]},{date:c,name:[{type:a,text:"Adam",spans:[]}],comment:[{type:a,text:"Hey Billy, it's your old friend from Redbubble, Adam. Nice presentation on this website. The star-studded skull that changes direction with the mouse is pretty cool. As always, your photography is awesome. Some I have seen, some are new to me. Really fell in love with the infrared one with the creek and the low grass; a total knockout image for me. I wish you much success with your new site.\nTake care,\nAdam",spans:[]}],reply:[{type:a,text:"Always a treat to get feedback from old RB friends Adam, many thanks for popping in!\nCool you dig the studded skull, my designer just rocked up with the idea and it was a no-brainer to put it on the welcome page. Don't think it moves on an iPhone so I'm happy you're on a machine that lets it do its thing :-)\nHappy too you like the infrared... few these days know what it was like to work with that amazing film which exposed to heat rather than light. It reacted differently to varied ambient conditions and you had to bracket pretty wide to make sure you ended up with a result. Florida seemed to love the stuff.\nCheers for the wish, Take care you too !!",spans:[]}]},{date:"2020-07-07",name:[{type:a,text:"David",spans:[]}],comment:[{type:a,text:"Bonjour Bill, tu fais preuve d'un réel éclectisme.On pourrait dire qu'il n'y a pas de ligne directrice et pourtant on ressent quand même un style certain.La volonté de surprendre et parfois d'attendrir est présente dans toute ton oeuvre.On est en permanence étonné ou contemplatif.L'ennui n'existe pas dans ton Travail.C'est excellent et très inventif.We want more.",spans:[]}],reply:[{type:a,text:"David, c'est un immense plaisir de recevoir un tel compliment de la part d'une personne aussi douée de créativité que toi.
