The owner, a gifted coppersmith of 20 years, has a son who`s a  gifted drummer. Between the two of them they decided to try making drum  kits out of metal and made their name making models from mainly  aluminum, and brass. The copper model here is their latest endeavor.  Called the Cuprano, it`s made of 1,2 mm thick copper. And though it`s  metallic, it has the warmth of sound of a wood kit but with amazing  definition and focus. \nI won`t bore you with tech details… if you`re a drummer and wanna know more, you only gotta ask :-)",spans:[]},{type:b,text:"As  is usually the case, I was elected to take its portrait for the studio  FB page and website. This posed problems as not only was the copper  polished and highly reflective, but the surfaces were curved. This meant  that using my standard flash set up with two 250W heads with 60 cm soft  boxes would give me the dynamic to bring out the stunning finish… but  it would also produce burned out areas where the flash reflected  straight back through the lens, and there would also be large areas of  dark where the relative darkness of the room reflected in the areas  curving away from the light source (does this make sense so far?) And to  further complicate things, there was so much fine detail in the  construction that needed to be faithfully reproduced: the laser  lettering on the bass drum rim, the brass logo plates, the intricate  chrome hardware and the surface work of the copper.",spans:[]},{type:b,text:"I solved all  those issues by taking an additional shot exposed for the natural light  in the room without flash. I then superimposed the lit shot over the  non-lit shot in Photoshop and simply erased the parts of the lit shot  that were problematic. I was left with a lovely range of copper tones  from cool to warm, the dynamic range that makes the kit so visually  stunning when you see it for real.\nI also added two smaller flashes  (each with hot shoe light sensor to trigger them when the main flashes  fired) behind the bass drum directed up the rear wall to inject  additional dynamic behind the kit and which also reflected a bit off the  floor tiles.",spans:[]},{type:b,text:"Canon EOS 5D MkIII + EF 24-105 L IS, Manual 1\u002F125 sec, f 13, ISO 400\nUni-Loc tripod with Novoflex ball head\n2 x Elinchrom 250 watt flash heads with portable 60 cm soft boxes sync’d to camera set at full power\n2 x remote Canon flash heads with light trigger hot shoe fittings.",spans:[]}],tag:"music"}}],fetch:[],mutations:void 0}}(null,"paragraph",800,320)));
