With the camera on timer mode  and set to f8 at 1 sec., I shot the pellet when the timer hit zero. A  home-made switch made with 2 sheets of metal foil triggered the flash  when the pellet hit it through the glass, and so the action was frozen.  The one second shutter speed ensured that all the action would be  captured, including blur of flying shards. Destroyed 3 glasses to make  sure I got at least one good picture, and spent an hour cleaning up the  kitchen.",spans:[]},{type:b,text:"The lightning, from a thunderstorm taken out the bedroom  window, was added with Photoshop as was the flashpoint above the pepper.  Both the lightning and exploding glass were shot on Fuji Reala 100 ISO  color print film on a Canon EOS-100 with 28-80 USM lens.
