I figured if anything  went wrong, I`d still have an untouched basic shot to fall back on.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"I  then shut the window, pulled the blind (hey, the neighbors talk!) and  ran off a bunch of selfies with the self timer in different poses. I  held the rocket in all of these as I knew it had to be pointed out the  window and it would have been hard to get my hand in the right position  without actually holding it. The part of the string hanging straight  down was part of this take.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"Next I took a piece of firework fuse  (blew me away you could actually buy that by the meter in Brussels!),  held it with hot dog tongs over some aluminum foil to save the carpet,  and lit it when the self timer counted to zero. The fuse burned really  fast so I set the exposure different on 4 takes to make sure I got it  right… used 1\u002F60 sec in the end.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"The cat was next… and Scratch  tried to run away so I knew he`d be great! I held him just above the  floor, and as the self timer approached zero, I dropped him…. 8 times!  Got some amazing expressions that way, this was the best as he looked  back at me saying “you`ve done some crazy shit, but now you`ve just gone  f`ing MAD!”",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"Not really knowing how I was going to “tie” him to  the rocket, I made some string shots, having used a marker I`d put on  the floor during the original shots of me holding the rocket. Here I  used one that I ran upwards with a bow knot that I stuck onto my black  camera bag at the height I figured Scratch`s neck would be so it would  look as if tied to his collar.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"Lastly, the fireworks out the  window were taken several years ago during a firework display in the  Algarve, Portugal. I did a bit of layer blending so the view through the  glass of the closed window frame would maintain a bit of its original  reflection.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"The difficult stuff being done, it was a blast putting  everything together in Photoshop… although there were some tedious  bits. “cutting out” the spikes in my hair and the sparks of the burning  fuse to blend in with the background was a pain, as was changing the  wording on the helium balloon from Happy Birthday to Happy New Year (why  can`t you get New Year balloons in May??). I also made sure the light  direction was consistent in all the elements and added shadows where  necessary. Only other processing was adjusting brightness levels and  cloning out some of the dead spiders in the corner behind the radiator.  Oh, and I changed the color of the walls and painted the radiator which  is actually off-white.",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"All elements except fireworks were shot with a Canon EOS 5D MkI + EF 28-80 USM.
